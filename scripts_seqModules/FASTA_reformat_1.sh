##---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 0) Called like : "sh FASTA_reformat_1.sh file.fa"
# 1) For lines that start with ">", convert the ending "\n" into "\t".
# 2) Removes all newline characters.
# 3) Adds newlines in front of ">"s to split FASTA entries onto separate lines.
# 4) Replaces the tab characters with newlines, to restore proper fasta format.
# 5) Remove initial blank lines...  added above as artifact of adding lines between entries.
